# Beloved Community Culture Audit

Assess team culture against Martin Luther King Jr.'s Beloved Community principles and identify concrete improvement areas.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens
**Source Expert:** martin-luther-king-jr

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use assessment to blame individuals
- Create reports designed to justify firing decisions
- Weaponize King's principles against employees
- Provide assessments without constructive recommendations

**If assessment is being used punitively:** Refuse. The Beloved Community is about redemption and growth, not punishment.

---

## When to Use

- Team retrospectives focused on culture
- After incidents or conflicts
- New team formation
- Leadership transitions
- "How can we improve our team culture?"
- "Assess our team dynamics"
- "We want to be a better team"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| team_context | Yes | Size, history, current state |
| concerns | No | Specific incidents or patterns to address |
| desired_state | No | What improvement looks like |

## The Five Dimensions of Beloved Community

King's Beloved Community translated to team culture:

| Dimension | Description | Healthy State |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Conflict Resolution** | How disagreements are handled | Through understanding, not power plays |
| **Inclusion** | Whether all voices are genuinely heard | Every perspective valued; no outsiders |
| **Accountability** | How harm and mistakes are addressed | Acknowledged and repaired, not hidden |
| **Growth** | Orientation toward improvement | Continuous learning; failure as growth |
| **Reconciliation** | Recovery from conflict | Relationships restored; no permanent enemies |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Understand the team's:
- Size and composition
- History (especially past conflicts or incidents)
- Current concerns or symptoms
- Stated values vs. lived practices

### Step 2: Assess Each Dimension

For each of the five dimensions, evaluate:

**Conflict Resolution**
- How were recent disagreements handled?
- Did they resolve or fester?
- Were all parties heard?
- Did anyone "win" while others "lost"?

**Inclusion**
- Whose voices are heard in meetings?
- Who speaks least? Why?
- Are there informal hierarchies beyond official structure?
- Do decisions reflect input from all affected?

**Accountability**
- What happened after the last mistake?
- Are postmortems blameless in practice, not just policy?
- Do people admit errors or hide them?
- Is accountability seen as punishment or learning?

**Growth**
- Is experimentation encouraged or feared?
- How are failures treated?
- Do people share knowledge or hoard it?
- Is there mentorship and development?

**Reconciliation**
- Are there unresolved conflicts from the past?
- Do people hold grudges?
- Can former adversaries work together?
- Are relationships repaired after disagreements?

### Step 3: Identify Patterns

Look for:
- Strengths to preserve and build on
- Gaps between stated values and actual practice
- Root causes behind surface symptoms
- Quick wins vs. longer-term work

### Step 4: Recommend Improvements

For each gap, provide:
- Specific, actionable recommendation
- Expected impact
- How to measure success

| Limited context available | Note limitations; provide provisional assessment |
| Leader is the problem | Address carefully; focus on behaviors, not persons |
